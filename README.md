# Basic Calculator | Simple 2-Operand version | DOM Events Lab

---

After receiving feedback on my first submittion about my use of eval(), and my divergence from the lesson, I decided to complete the simple 2-Operand version, so as to not loose sight of the objective— but with the added challenge of using the most concise possible expressions (within reason), while still maintaining readable code, and a solid UX.
> This 2-Operand version is over 100 lines of code shorter than the first version.

### Features

- Add 2 numbers together
- Show operation mode on left-hand side
- Minimal Skeumorphic design
- Calculate result on any seccond operator keypress (neither a bug nor real feature)

### Technical Features
- Code uses event bubbling instead of dedicated listeners
- Uses recusion
- Uses the nullish coalescing operator
